This code parses from a text file to create objects. These objects make up the game. It takes a game description, it creates rooms, items, containers, inventory etc.
The game can therefore be whatever you want it to be, you just have to change the text file (but keeping it in the right format).
Creating this game taught me a lot about object oriented programming, making use of things such as inheritance, improving use of git etc.

(To clone and use, make sure to change the path for the text file in the Game.java file)
